I am a self-taught programmer from Poland, with a keen interest in backend and frontend development. My approach to learning is self-directed and practical, focusing on applying theoretical knowledge to solve complex problems. Alongside my girlfriend @niebielistki,  we form a dedicated duo, committed to continuous improvement, mutual support and knowledge sharing in our software development journey. My remote work experience has honed my self-organization skills, with the Pomodoro technique ensuring my productivity and focus. My interests also include music (with ambitions in music programming), movies, natural medicine, new technology and art. I love working surrounded by my plants in my apartment.
